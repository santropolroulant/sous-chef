# Contributing to Sous-Chef

First of all, thanks for reading this and taking time to contribute! :+1: We need volunteer developers to help this project grow.

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Sous-Chef, which is hosted in the [Savoir-faire Linux organization](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux) on GitHub.
Feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

If you haven't already, please join us on IRC: `#souschef` on Freenode.

## How can I contribute ?

### Code contribution

A pre-requisite is to have Sous-Chef installed on your machine.
The installation procedure is based on Docker and is described [on GitHub](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/blob/dev/INSTALL.md).

#### Issues

If you are unsure where to begin contribution to Sous-Chef, you can start by looking through the issues page.
Numerous issues are created and waiting for your love on the [issue board](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/issues).

You may also use [Waffle](https://waffle.io/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef) as a more *Agile-like* dashboard.

Please refer to the issues labels and topics for more information on how categorizing the issues.

#### Pull Requests

Contributions will be accepted through the creation of Pull Requests. Here is the workflow:

* Fork the repository into yours and work from there
* Commit and push your changes into your fork
* When you are done, create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/compare) in Feast repository on the **dev** branch

A template is provided to create your Pull Request. Try to fill the information at the best of your knowledge.

#### Pull request checklist

For your pull request to be merged, the answer to the following questions must be 'yes':

##### General

* Can the branch be merged automatically?

##### Testing

* Do the unit tests pass?

##### Adding new code

* Is the code PEP8 compliant?
* Is the code covered by tests?
* Are the strings internationalised?
* Is the url templatetag used when declaring urls? (are the templates exempt of hardcoded urls?)

[TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) is configured to run those checks on every Pull-Request. It is recommanded you configure your fork to do the same.

Note: You may have a "coverage decreased" message after creating the pull request. It may happen with trivial changes: [example1](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/pull/633/files), [example2](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/pull/671/files). Don't worry about it in these cases. We will verify the commits.

### Documentation

Documentation is important and can always be improved:

* Installation instructions
* Test procedures
* How to help translating the project
* Updating the [Roadmap](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/wiki/ROADMAP)

The prefered syntax is Asciidoc. Markdown is also accepted.

The [project wiki](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/sous-chef/wiki/) on GitHub could also be used.

### Reporting bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

#### How to submit a good bug report

Please include as many details as possible. An issue template is automatically loaded when you create an issue.

* Use a clear and comprehensive title for the issue
* Describe the expected behaviour in as many details as possible
* Describe the actual behaviour in as many details as possible
* Detail the steps which reproduce the problem
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs. You can use [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) on Linux.

### Testing the application

Our development process is based on Continuous Integration. We love to have a nice code coverage!

Each Django module comes with its own `tests.py` file. Feel free to implement missing unit or functional tests.
